# Vehicle-Fleet-Analysis
Analysing network logs and CAN Traces of Vehicles, extrapolating anomalous data points into insights, translating raw results into advisable actions.

#The Purpose of this project is to analyse the given logs (network and CAN traffic), and translate them into meaningful conclusions, uncovering attacks and vulnerabilities.
Source data is presented via Network_Logs and Vehicle_Logs for the network trace and CAN trace (of a single vehicle) respectively.

The solution of the exercise is presented in Analysis_Report.docx
Additional challenging CAN trace is presented in Challenge_CAN_Trace.txt, solution to which is Challenge_CAN_Trace_Solution.docx
